                Hi! I am Gabriel but you can call me <b className="curious">Gallo</b>.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                <b className="curious">Dog lover</b>, <b className="curious">bibliophile</b> and <b className="curious">gym
                    enthusiast</b>. Originally from the beautiful and vibrant city of Guadalajara, Mexico, where I studied <b className="curious">architecture</b> and graduated from
                <a className="hyperlink" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2e2e2e;" href="https://www.tec.mx/en">Tec de
                    Monterrey</a>.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                I then started working as a freelancer, developing architectural concepts, schematic designs and a few websites. In 2020 I moved to the craziest of cities <b className="curious">(New York City)</b>, where I currently live and work as an
                <b className="curious">architect designer</b> for <a className="hyperlink" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2e2e2e;" href="https://www.rockwellgroup.com/">Rockwell Group</a>.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                At <a className="hyperlink" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2e2e2e;" href="https://www.rockwellgroup.com/">Rockwell Group</a>, I have worked hand in hand with a diverse group of interior designers, architects and project managers
                on multiple projects ranging in scale, scope and location. From <b className="curious">educational architecture</b>, to <b className="curious">mixed-use commercial developments</b>, I have found that I become impassioned with whatever project
                I tackle.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                My expertise is in the fields of <b className="curious">architecture</b> and <b className="curious">design</b> with some exposure to <b className="curious">web development</b>, however, my passion and desire to constantly learn and evolve take
                me to explore new fields such as <b className="curious">finance</b> and <b className="curious">technology</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In short, like a good friend describes me, <b className="curious">“Gallo is a paradox: whereas he feeds off routine and staying lean, he will always strive to be more well rounded!”</b>
